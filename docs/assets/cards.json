                    "general": "The High Priestess is steeped in symbolism and mystery. She is often depicted sitting between two pillars, one black and one white, representing the dualities of existence—conscious and unconscious, light and shadow. These pillars mark the gateway to sacred knowledge and the balance needed to access it. She sits before a thin veil adorned with pomegranates, signifying fertility, abundance, and the divine feminine. The veil itself separates the seen from the unseen, the known from the unknown, and is only parted for those who are prepared to look beyond the surface. The High Priestess wears a blue robe with a cross on her chest, indicating her expansive knowledge and her role as a divine ruler. Upon her head, she dons a crown with horns, further emphasizing her connection to the divine. In her lap, she holds a partially concealed scroll labeled “TORA,” hinting at hidden spiritual insights that are revealed only when one is ready to look beyond the material realm. At her feet lies a crescent moon, linking her to the divine feminine, the rhythms of nature, and the subconscious mind. The moon reflects her deep intuition and the cyclical nature of time and human experience. The High Priestess embodies wisdom, intuition, and the mysteries that lie within the subconscious. She invites seekers to delve into the depths of their inner world, to uncover the secrets that lie within, and to embrace the balance between the known and the unknown. She is a guardian of the sacred, a keeper of hidden truths, and a bridge between the mundane and the mystical.",
